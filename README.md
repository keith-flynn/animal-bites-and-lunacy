## Summary
---
The goal of this project is to discover if there is any correlation between animal bites reported in Louisville, KY between October 29th 2009 and September 8th 2017, and the phase of the moon when the bite occurred. The bite dataset contains reports from many other years, but the reporting is inconsistent and missing most of the applicable data points.
